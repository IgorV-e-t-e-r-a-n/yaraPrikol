# 1. Research YARA Rule Structure and Create Templates
#     - Task: Understand the structure of YARA rules, including required and common attributes.
#     - Output: Define a basic YARA rule template with placeholders for patterns, metadata, and conditions.

# 2. Collect Data for Signature Generation
#     - Task: Decide on the types of data youâ€™ll analyze (malware files, network signatures, behavioral patterns).
#     - Output: Collect a sample dataset to test the YARA rule generation process.




# 3. Develop a Script to Analyze Data and Identify Patterns
#     - Task: Write a Python script that:
#         - Loads each sample file.
#         - Extracts unique patterns (e.g., strings, hashes, binary patterns).
#         - Compiles these patterns into a list of signatures.
#     - Output: Code that processes files and returns a list of unique patterns.




# 4. Generate YARA Rules from Template and Extracted Data
#     - Task: Write code to:
#         - Load the YARA rule template.
#         - Replace placeholders in the template with extracted patterns (signatures).
#         - Output a YARA rule for each analyzed file.
#     - Output: A set of YARA rules generated from the template.




# 5. Test Generated Rules
#     - Task: Test each YARA rule to:
#         - Ensure it detects the file it was generated from.
#         - Adjust any patterns to reduce false positives or errors.
#     - Output: Refined YARA rules that detect the intended files.




# 6. (Optional) Build a User Interface for Rule Generation
#     - Task: If desired, create a simple console or graphical interface that allows users to:
#         - Select files to analyze.
#         - View or modify generated rules.
#     - Output: Basic interface for managing rule generation.




# 7. Initial YARA Rule Template
#     - Define a template to be populated in Step 4. Example:

#       rule RuleName
#       {
#           meta:
#               description = "Placeholder for rule description"
#               author = "Placeholder for author"
#               date = "Placeholder for date"
#           strings:
#               $string1 = "example_string"  // Patterns to be added here
#               $string2 = { E2 34 A1 C3 }   // Binary patterns here
#           condition:
#               all of them
#       }
